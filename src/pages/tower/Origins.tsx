                  selected based on its cultural resonance, sustainability, and structural feasibility.

                  The space-constrained site at a prominent intersection in Kuwait City center

                  toward the Gulf views to the north, west, and east.

                  The podium and parking structure were already under construction when SOM joined

                  both challenges—creating the carved southwest opening while progressively rotating 
                  floor plates to optimize Gulf views at higher elevations.
